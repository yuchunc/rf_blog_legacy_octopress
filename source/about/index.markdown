##Hi, I'm Mickey
You have stumble uppon my blog, it's a dark and scary place where I probably fucking around with somehting. Don't worry, I promise I won't break too many things in the process. =).

I'm a Ruby on Rails guy, and relatively new to the web scene, so I won't pretend I know everything. However, I'm facinated by web technologies and design, and I am self desplined to learn abit everyday.

But we are not here to talk about web technology. This is my blog, so it is going to be about little old me, Mickey. I love my family, geeky stuff, kung fu, traveling and many other things. so this blog is going to be about them, and me. And whatever I wanna talk about.

##CHEERS!!
