I have been reading about working standing up since two years ago, finally stumble upon an affortable solution. This is what my desk looks like now.

[Here is the original post.](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html)

So for any Taiwanese folk reading this, here's a list of things I bought:

# Ikea item list

1. LACK 邊桌          $245    901.616.73
2. EKBY JÄRPEN 層板   $395    301.814.95
3. EKBY VALTER 支撐架 $50 X 2 401.674.89
4. Some bare screws

All of the items add up to about $740NTD. I got 2 tables for my dual screens, and bigger work space is really wonderful. I wished I had taken more pictures during the assembly, but it was pretty straightfoward.

After working without a chair for almost a month, my butt feels much tighter, and my leggs has became stronger. However, I do fatigue much faster during my kung-fu class, it would probably improved after I am more used to the new workspace.
